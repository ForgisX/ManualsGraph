**From Manuals to Troubleshooting Graphs: Generative Knowledge Extraction for Industrial Maintenance**

## Mission

ManualsGraph aims to transform the vast, unstructured world of industrial machine manuals into structured, actionable causal knowledge graphs. By extracting "symptom → root cause → fix" relationships, we enable real-time fault diagnosis and automated repair guidance that is both interpretable and deployable on edge devices.

## Core Pillars

1.  **Scalable Parsing**: Handling complex, semi-structured documents (PDFs) at scale.
2.  **Generative Extraction**: Leveraging LLMs to move beyond regex and heuristics into semantic understanding.
3.  **Graph Reasoning**: Building DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structures that mirror the logical flow of troubleshooting.
4.  **Edge Optimized**: Compressing knowledge into lightweight formats capable of running on factory-floor hardware.
